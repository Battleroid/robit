# robit

Working A Star implementation on a grid, however, using a shape for our 'robot' along with polygonal obstacles. Seems to work okay, still needs work. Since I need a hardcopy of the source I've put up a [LaTeX](robot.tex) document and [PDF](robot.pdf).

### note

The proper solution when faced with polygonal obstacles and whatnot is to use a navigation mesh with offsets for the shape and size of the robot itself. However, this is pretty difficult and I had only two weeks to learn most of the relevant bits for JavaFX and make it work so it's good enough. _Acceptable_ is the key word here.
